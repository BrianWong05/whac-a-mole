# Proposal: Create Whac-A-Mole Game

## Goal
Develop a responsive, web-based "Whac-A-Mole" game tailored for "Exceptional Child" training to improve hand-eye coordination.

## Summary
This project will introduce a complete React-based game application using Vite and Tailwind CSS. The game features a forgiving design for accessibility, a specialized "no-zoom" UI for touch interactions, and a positive-reinforcement game loop. It will be deployed to a subdirectory (`/whac-a-mole/`) using HashRouter.

## Key Features
- **Accessibility**: Forgiving hitboxes and disable zoom on double-tap.
- **Therapeutic Focus**: Positive feedback only (stars/hearts), no penalty for misses.
- **Tech Stack**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS.
- **Deployment**: Configured for GitHub Pages/sub-path deployment.
