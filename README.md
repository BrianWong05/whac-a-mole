## Mission & "Why This Exists"

The **Whac-A-Mole Training** project is a specialized therapeutic tool designed for **Occupational Therapy** and **Special Education**, specifically tailored for **Exceptional Children** (Special Needs). 

Beyond being just a game, this app serves as a practical training platform to:
- **Train Hand Muscles:** Encouraging precise motor movements and strengthening finger-hand coordination.
- **Improve Focus:** Challenging children to track moving targets in a controlled environment.
- **"No-Fail" Environment:** Designed to reduce anxiety and build confidence through positive reinforcement.

### Accessibility Features
- **"Forgiving Hitboxes" (Antigravity Mechanic):** Larger interaction zones to assist children with limited fine motor control.
- **High Contrast Visuals:** Clear, vibrant targets and backgrounds to aid visual tracking.
- **Adaptable Orientation:** Seamlessly transitions between Landscape and Portrait modes to suit different device setups.

## Key Features

### 📱 Dual Orientation
The app is fully responsive and optimized for:
- **Vertical (Phone):** Perfect for one-handed practice and quick sessions.
- **Horizontal (Tablet/Split-screen):** Ideal for therapy sessions where a larger interaction area is beneficial.

### ⚙️ Adaptive Difficulty
- **Easy Mode:** Spawns one target at a time, allowing the user to focus on a single point.
- **Challenge Mode:** Increases complexity by spawning up to two targets simultaneously.

### ✨ Positive Reinforcement
- **Empowering Feedback:** High-quality audio feedback and rewarding visual effects for every successful hit.
- **Stress-Free:** We intentionally omitted negative buzzer sounds or "Game Over" penalties to maintain a supportive atmosphere.

### 🛠️ Custom Settings
- **Adjustable Speed:** Slow down for beginners or speed up for more advanced training.
- **Target Size:** Scale the interactive elements to match the child's motor skill level.
